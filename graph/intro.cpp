//graph 
//intro 

//components -> 
//Nodes - these are states / vertex 

//Edges - these ate links bw these states / vertex. (2 types) ->
//directed - 1 way edge ( a to b only)
//undirected - 2 way edge (a to b and b to a)


//Representation of Graphs ->]

//Adjacency Matrix - 2d array where a[i][j] = 1 only when there is an edge from i to j

//Adjacency List - array of list


//Searching Algorithms ->

//DFS - first go to the depth and see if there is anymore depth to go or not, if not then backtrack 

//BFS - normal go from the top and check the bottom elements; implemented using queues
